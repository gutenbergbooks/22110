<h1>MARTIAN V.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;W.</h1>

<h2>By G.&nbsp;L. VANDENBURG</h2>




<p class="tease"><big><b><i>There's nothing like a parade, I always<br />
say. Of course, I'm a Martian.</i></b></big></p>


<p>Mr. Cruthers was a busy
man. Coordinating the biggest
parade in New York's history
is not easy. He was maneuvering
his two hundred pounds
around Washington Square with
the agility of a quarterback. He
had his hands full organizing
marchers, locating floats, placing
the many brass bands in
their proper order and barking
commands to assistants. But
Mr. Cruthers approached the
job with all the zeal of an evangelist
at a revival meeting.</p>

<p>As he approached the south-west
corner of the square he saw
something that jarred his already
frayed nerves. He stopped
abruptly. The mass of clipboards
and papers he was carrying fell
to the street. There before him
were one hundred and fifty ants,
each of them at least six feet
tall. His first impulse was to
turn and run for the nearest
doctor. He was certain that the
strain of his job was proving
too much for him. But one of
the ants approached him. It
seemed friendly enough, so Mr.
Cruthers stood his ground.</p>

<p>"My group is waiting for
their assignment." The ant's
voice seemed to be coming from
the very core of its thorax which
was a violent red.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Mr. Cruthers'
mouth opened up as wide as an
oven door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cruthers, I believe the
parade is about to start and my
group&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Cruthers managed to
blurt out. "What the devil <i>are</i>
you anyway!"</p>

<p>"This <i>is</i> the parade marking
the International Geophysical
Year, is it not?" The ant had a
pleasant, friendly voice.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you are Mr. Cruthers,
the manager of the parade, is
that not correct?"</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Mr. Cruthers rubbed his eyes
and took another look at the
strange creature. Its head was
a brilliant yellow. It had two
large goggle eyes which rolled
like itinerant marbles when it
spoke. The low slung abdomen
was a burnt brown. It was bad
enough, Cruthers thought, that
these ants were six feet tall, but
it was nightmarish to see them
in three colors.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cruthers," the ant continued,
"haven't you been instructed
by the National Academy
of Sciences that the Martian
V.F.W. is to participate in
this parade?"</p>

<p>"The Martian&mdash;!!" Mr. Cruthers'
mouth was open again.
Then he realized that when the
ant spoke its mouth didn't move.
He picked up his clipboard and
papers from the street. His voice
was hostile now. "What the hell
is this, some kind of a gag!
What are you trying to do, scare
a man half to death!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're not joking, Mr.
Cruthers. The National Academy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They didn't say anything to
me about a bunch of clowns
dressed up like ants!" Mr. Cruthers'
indignation became intensified.
He was loathe to admit
that he'd been taken in by such
obviously animated costumes.
"Now look here, I'm a very busy
man."</p>

<p>"The arrangements <i>have</i> been
made, Mr. Cruthers. If my
group is refused a place in this
parade we shall file suit immediately.
As manager you'll be
named co-defendant." The ant
was gentle but firm.</p>

<p>The thought of being sued
softened Mr. Cruthers' attitude.
"Well, I'm very sorry, pal, but
every contingent in this parade
is listed on my clipboard and
you're not. I know this list by
heart. What did you say the
name of your group was?"</p>

<p>"The Martian V.F.W."</p>

<p>Mr. Cruthers was amused.
"Those sure are the craziest outfits
I've ever seen," he chuckled.
"Where'd you get them? Walt
Disney make them for you?" He
followed his own little joke with
a long throaty laugh.</p>

<p>The ant was impatient.
"About the parade, Mr. Cruthers,
there isn't much time."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the parade. Well, let
me see," he thumbed through
the clipboard, "I guess there's
always room for a few laughs.
How many in your group?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty. And
we also have a float with us. Not
a very large one. It measures
twenty by twenty."</p>

<p>"Tell you what. You move
your group to the corner of
Thompson Street and Third
Street. Get behind the Tiffany
float and follow them, okay?"</p>

<p>The ant paused a moment to
record the instructions in his
mind. Then he turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a minute," Mr. Cruthers
cried before the ant could
rejoin his group. "Just who did
you speak to at the National
Academy of Sciences?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was a Mr. Canfield."</p>

<p>Mr. Cruthers' face lit up.
"Well, why didn't you say so in
the first place! I'd have placed
you right away."</p>

<p>"That's perfectly all right,
Mr. Cruthers."</p>

<p>"Listen, I don't know what
you guys do but those costumes
should certainly bring the house
down. There's going to be four
million people watching this parade.
I bet that's the biggest
audience you've ever seen."</p>

<p>"It certainly is." With that
the ant strode away.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" Mr. Cruthers
shouted after him.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"Daddy! Daddy, look! Look
at the big rocket!" The little boy
jumped up and down gleefully.
"It must be a whole mile long,
Daddy! What kind is it?"</p>

<p>"That's the Vanguard, son."</p>

<p>An autumn breeze from the
East River chilled their vantage
point at Sixty-First Street and
Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>"The Vanguard?" The name
meant nothing to the boy. "Gee,
I'll bet it can fly all the way to
the stars!"</p>

<p>"It's the rocket that carried
the first artificial satellite into
space."</p>

<p>The parade, now three hours
old, continued past the reviewing
stand.</p>

<p>"I wanna get a better look at
the Vanguard!" the boy shouted.</p>

<p>The father lifted the boy onto
his shoulders. The little fellow
laughed and whooped it up, firing
several shots from his Captain
Video Ray gun at the passing
missile.</p>

<p>The rocket moved on and the
noise of the crowd diminished
slightly.</p>

<p>A one-hundred piece brass
band was passing in front of
them. They were playing "The
Stars and Stripes Forever."
They were followed by the Sak's
Fifth Avenue display; nine
small floats, each depicting life
on another planet. The National
Academy of Sciences had a success
on its hands.</p>

<p>"Wow! Daddy, I wanna ride
on it! I wanna ride on that float
and visit all those planets! Can
I, Daddy!" The boy became all
limbs trying to squirm down
from his father's shoulders.</p>

<p>"You stay right where you are,
young man," the father struggled
to hold his balance.</p>

<p>"But I wanna go to the stars.
I can watch the rest of the parade
from Venus or Mercury!
Please, Daddy!"</p>

<p>The father grinned. "Not just
yet, son, but it won't be long
before man will go to the stars."</p>

<p>"Who lives up there, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't any life up
there yet."</p>

<p>"If no one's living up there
why does anyone want to go
there?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe there'll be too
many people on earth someday
and then we'll have to find other
planets with more room."</p>

<p>Another monstrous brass
band was going by. The boy became
restless. He began to toy
with his ray gun, half interested
in seeing if there were any
sparks left in it. "Why can't
there be something besides so
many bands in a parade? I wanna
see another float."</p>

<p>The father tried to interest
the boy by pointing out all the
famous people who were also
there: a variety of statesmen
the world's leading scientists
and religious and cultural leaders,
the president of the United
States.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The boy was interested but
not in what his elder was saying
to him. He was looking downtown,
his eyes squinting, trying
to make out figures as far away
as Fifty-sixth Street. Then his
mouth opened, not uttering a
sound yet, just waiting to burst
with joy at what was coming toward
them.</p>

<p>His father looked up at him.
"I wish you'd tell me what you
are looking at. I'm all the way
down here on street level, remember?"</p>

<p>"Daddy, they look like ants!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Ants, Daddy, ants! A whole
army of them. Ain't it exciting?"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"They're doing somersaults
and back flips and everything!
They're coming right this way!
Gee, there's hundreds of them.
And they got a float behind
them, Daddy! A great big float
with something burning on it."</p>

<p>The child sitting on his shoulders
made mobility impossible
for the father. And he couldn't
see around the spectators. He
resigned himself to stand and
wait for this new spectacle to
overtake them. The reaction to
this new sight had already begun
to work its way uptown. In
the distance, but getting closer
every second, he could hear unrestrained
laughter and rejoicing.</p>

<p>"Hey, take it easy!" The boy
was beginning to ride the shoulders
like a bronco buster. "By
the time they get here I won't
have any shoulders left. Where
are they now?"</p>

<p>"They're almost here, Daddy!
And they aren't ants at all.
They're just a bunch of clowns
dressed up like it." He began
to giggle hysterically. "Golly,
they're funny. Can you see them
yet, Daddy?"</p>

<p>Before the father could produce
an answer the ants were
in view. They were a sight that
couldn't fail to stimulate the
funny bone. By comparison with
real ants everything about them
had been grossly exaggerated to
achieve the proper effect. They
walked on their two back legs
but the four front apertures
were far from idle. Some of
them turned somersaults, others
did complicated flips consisting
of two or three spins in mid-air.
Still others, doing a kind of animated
cakewalk, carried toy ray
guns which they fired at random
into the crowd. The guns were
something like the little boy's
Captain Video ray gun, only
larger. They emitted little
streaks of blue sparks which
shone brightly but disappeared
when contact was made with air.</p>

<p>They were easily the hit of
the parade, a three ring circus
all by themselves, as they
pranced and clowned their way
up Fifth Avenue giving the
spectators a whale of a show
that was completely new.</p>

<p>The guests on the reviewing
stand refrained from any hilarity
until they saw the float that
four of the ants were pulling behind
them. It was in keeping
with the rest of the nonsense
they were perpetrating. The
float boasted eight larger ray
guns, three on either side and
two in the rear, that fired the
same fascinating blue sparks.
Behind each gun an ant stood on
its head, wildly waving six legs
in the breeze, begging to be noticed
and laughed at. Above the
guns, emblazoned in fiery orange
letters, were the words: "MARTIAN
V.F.W." This was interpreted
by one and all as a punch
line and was treated accordingly.</p>

<p>It was heartwarming to be
able to see the president and so
many other dignitaries abandon
composure in favor of a good old
fashioned belly laugh.</p>

<p>"Daddy, I can't laugh any
more," the boy had to pause between
every other word. "My
stomach hurts. Aren't they the
funniest things you ever saw?"</p>

<p>The father was too convulsed
to be able to answer him.</p>

<p>"Daddy, one of them is coming
this way! He's firing his
Captain Video ray gun at us!"
They boy squeezed his father
and held on tight.</p>

<p>The father took a deep breath
in order to be able to speak.
"Take your gun and fire back
at him, son. Fire away! Go on,
he's just being playful!" He
broke forth with another gust
of laughter. "I won't see anything
as funny as this again if
I live to be a hundred!"</p>

<p>The ant pranced over to where
they were standing, firing its
gun in every direction. The boy
fired back. The ant took one look
at the lad's gun and let out a
long cackling sound which built
to a crescendo and then stopped
as though it had been turned off.
The ant rejoined the group and
they continued on their merry
way.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The boy fired several shots into
the float as it passed. He
wanted to see if he could knock
out those blazing orange letters:
MARTIAN V.F.W. The letters
continued to burn, but in the
boy's mind he was certain he
had made several direct hits.</p>

<p>The boy and his father watched
the float until it was out of
sight. They knew there wouldn't
be another attraction like those
ants. They must have been real
professionals, the father
thought. Such teamwork! Such
precision! Each one of them
having a specific job to do and
each doing it to perfection.
After them everything was
bound to be anticlimactic.</p>

<p>More marchers, more bands, a
few more floats. The boy was
beginning to tire. It had been a
long day. Now everything was
dull. "Daddy, I don't want to
see any more. Let's go home."</p>

<p>"We'll stay another five minutes."</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The parade somehow seemed
to be slowing down. The father
yawned and let his son down
from his shoulders. He looked
across the street at the president
and the other dignitaries on the
reviewing stand. All were slowly
raising their hands in salute as
another color guard drowsily
made its way by.</p>

<p>Soon the last group in the parade
was passing the reviewing
stand. Another brass band. They
were moving with the speed of
a glacier. A full five seconds
elapsed between each note of
music. Everything was happening
in slow motion. On the reviewing
stand the dignified
hands went up, agonizingly
slow, to a final salute and they
stayed there. The greatest
minds in the world stood motionless,
unalterably still. Just as
each wave of pandemonium had
unfurled itself up Fifth Avenue
during the parade, so now did
silence take command.</p>

<p>The little boy tugged at his
father's coat. "Daddy! Daddy,"
he pleaded, "why has the parade
stopped? I wan-na-go-home&mdash;"
His words came more slowly
with each passing second, like a
high speed phonograph playing
at thirty-three and a third r.p.m.
"Dad-dy&mdash;why&mdash;don't&mdash;you&mdash;an&mdash;swer&mdash;me&mdash;Da&mdash;ddy&mdash;why&mdash;don't&mdash;"
His
father never heard him.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Fifty miles above the Atlantic
the fleet of spaceships hung suspended
like lanterns. In the lead
ship the ant in charge of communications
reported to the
commander.</p>

<p>"We've just received the first
communique from the advance
guard, sir."</p>

<p>"Read it to me."</p>

<p>The communications chief
read from a large perforated
paper. "Time&mdash;0600&mdash;mission
accomplished. Manhattan island
cut down the middle&mdash;immediate
result of super-isonic rays; four
million dead&mdash;rays spreading
east and west&mdash;estimated time
of rays' full effect; 0800&mdash;island
will then be neutralized&mdash;awaiting
further orders." The ant
folded the paper and looked up
at the commander. "Shall I relay
further orders, sir?"</p>

<p>"No." The commander of the
ants paused and stroked his
chin. "We're moving in."</p>
